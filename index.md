# Hey there!

**I'm Gabyâ€”** a curious, thorough, and humble human motivated by personal growth and an aversion to inefficiency. I recently completed the **Back-End Engineering** program at [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io), and am thrilled to be making the transition from design to development.

In December 2020, I accepted a position at [BTI](http://bti-usa.com) as a **Full Stack Rails Developer**. Before that, I worked as a **Product Designer** for a healthcare + tech growth startup on a fully remote design team.

I also have ~10 years of experience working in the cycling industry in the form of bicycle mechanics & retail sales.

When I'm not glued to my computer following every interesting rabbit-hole, I'm probably out riding my bike, planning a backpacking trip, or paddling the rivers and springs of north central Florida with my best pup, Noodle.

This site is mostly an aimless dumping ground for disorganized writing, general thoughts, and regurgitating interesting (to me) information. Maybe an occasional tech post, who knows. :shrug: 

_It's also pretty new and often neglected, so bear with me._
