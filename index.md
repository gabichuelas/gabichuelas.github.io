# Hey there!
<br>

**I'm Gabyâ€”**a curious, thorough, and humble human motivated by personal growth and an aversion to inefficiency. Most recently, I worked as a **Product Designer** for a healthcare + tech growth startup on a fully remote design team.

I'm currently learning my way through the **back end engineering** program at Turing School of Software & Design, hoping to make a long-awaited transition into Software Development.

I also have ~10 years of experience working in the cycling industry in the form of bicycle mechanics & retail sales.

When I'm not glued to my computer following every interesting rabbit-hole, I'm probably out riding my bike, planning a backpacking trip, or paddling the rivers and springs of north central Florida with my best pup, Noodle.

_This site is pretty new. Bear with me._
