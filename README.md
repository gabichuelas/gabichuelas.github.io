This is the repo for my [personal site](https://gabichuelas.github.io/about) that will serve as a sporadic blogging escape: a way to track my learning progress over time both in terms of personal development/philosophies, technical knowledge, and outside interests. 

The end goal is that a visitor might glean a general understanding of who I am as a person and as a colleague.

**This is pretty new, and therefore a work in progress.**
