title: Celebrity at Dinner?

I finally have an answer (or at least one answer, when in the past I've had none) for the "if you could have dinner with anyone (deceased?), who would it be" question. **Ursula K. LeGuin.** I've always hated that question because it's not like you're really going to get anything out of one dinner date with somebody. You have to hang out enough times to get comfortable, pick up a vibe, and see if you are even able to coax the kind of conversation you'd value out of that interaction. Etc, etc, etc. 

If I had that chance with Ursula, I'd also find out what games she's into if any, and maybe bring her over to my favorite "neighborhood grandma's" place for light dinner and chit chat. I guess I don't want to just have dinner with her once, I just wouldn't mind having her as another adopted-wise-owl-elder...or something. I'd take life lessons from Ursula for sure. 

Currently reading this collection of hers: <br>[The Wave in the Mind: Talks and Essays on the Writer, the Reader, and the Imagination](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13650.The_Wave_in_the_Mind)

In a similar vein, also recommend:<br>
[No Time to Spare: Thinking About What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33503495-no-time-to-spare)

Small confession: I haven't even read the novels she's actually known for yet. Ursula is a recent discovery for me, and these essay collections really give me good insight (IMO) into who she was. The first one I planned on getting to is _The Left Hand of Darkness._
