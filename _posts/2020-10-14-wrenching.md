title: Coding is like Wrenching

I started working at a bike shop halfway through college in 2010, right around the time I got in to the [graphic design program at UF](https://arts.ufl.edu/academics/art-and-art-history/programs/design-and-visual-communications/). Over the years, it became obvious that I was enjoying wrenching on bikes more than almost anything else I was doing.

Working on bikes and working with the particular group of people at my last shop taught me a lot about myself and what excites me at work. It seems wrenching is a lot like coding. I relished having an encyclopedic knowledge of components and parts compatibility that helped me pick the right tools for the job. There was also a huge emphasis on documentation, so other mechanics could pick up where you left off. Everyone at the shop was equipped to problem solve quickly and efficiently, and it wouldn't have been possible without genuine pride in craft on everyone's part, and being attuned to what was happening around you at any given moment. That team was a well-oiled machine.

I eventually moved on from that world and spent a few years working as a designer at a health+tech startup, but coding is the only thing I've taken up since the early days of becoming a mechanic that has come close to matching the eagerness and persistence I felt then. Knowing that I'm not going to plateau on it any time soon (the job won't let you), and that getting really comfortable with the basics at a high level prepares you for everything else. 

I love and respect design, and want to stay close to it in some capacity, but it never quite made me feel as capable and empowered as I do now, and as wrenching made me feel too. In the past few years I've learned that there are different ways to be creative, and that a design mindset can be applied in any arena. [Pursuing software development](turing.io) was me recognizing my strengths and motivations, and finally acting on them.
