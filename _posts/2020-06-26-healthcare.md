title: Healthcare + Tech on Freakonomics

Earlier today I was driving back home from a week spent near the beach with my mother. We both had a bit of time off from school. Hers being her job, mine being Turing. Solo driving is my preferred time to indulge in podcasts or extensive daydreaming and brainstorming.

This time, I listened to [episode \#423](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/telehealth/) of Freakonomics titled _The Doctor Will Zoom You Now_, which was largely focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the large-scale (and hopefully not just temporary?) adoption of Telehealth.  

I recommend just listening to it, but here are some ideas that I found particularly stimulating and also frustrating in this episode:

  * A doctor being interviewed spoke about her decision (made long ago) to opt out of accepting insurance. Her justification centered around the fact that although she does not work for the insurance companies, she is, in a way, obligated to operate under their rules when considering treatment and/or procedures for her patients.

  The rules and extra steps required to do her job may not always align with the best interest of her patients, and in many cases unecessarily obstruct the diagnosis and treatment process.


  * Yet another factor contributing to the high cost of healthcare in this country (on top of a myriad other reasons including administrative costs, excessive waste of resources, high cost of drugs, etc.) is the fact that doctors will frequently order a more intensive (and more costly) course of diagnostic procedures, simply because they have to worry more about things like the high incident of lawsuits in the US.  

  > _From healthcare economist David Cutler:_
<br>The typical visit to a medical-care institution is more intensive in the U.S. than it is elsewhere. It’s likely to involve additional testing, maybe hospitalization. And a lot of that care is not really so essential. It’s done because the physician just wants to be sure, sometimes because he or she is afraid of being sued, sometimes because there’s an empty hospital bed, so you might as well use it.

* We need to get people out of institutions which will help lower overall mecical costs, which we can't do unless there is more of an emphasis on prevention in healthcare.
  > So, the complaint from providers is always — well, the complaint from everyone really — is always that prevention is not monetized, you’re not incentivized, and that procedures and treatment are.

This last idea was buttoned up nicely by the observation that "health care is the most information-intensive industry in the economy, and it uses information technology among the least of any industry".

This of course got me thinking yet again about one of the core reasons I wanted to become a developer in the first place:

> I aspire to use my future skills as a software engineer to someday work on what I think is one of the most crucial issues of our time: how to reconcile the benefits and dangers of big data as it relates to the future of healthcare, the protection of privacy, and the inherent role of behavioral psychology in all of it.

Now I'm aware that's lofty as hell, but I feel that some optimism and hope is important if one wants to contribute in a positive way to society. I have no idea what variety of projects I will work on in the future, but I know I'll be trying hard to make sure it's something I can get behind, and for the greater good.
