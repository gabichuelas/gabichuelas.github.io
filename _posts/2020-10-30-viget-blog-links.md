I've been spending an inordinate amount of time on the [Viget blog](https://www.viget.com/articles/). Every time I think I'm done, I keep coming back and getting sucked in for hours. This hasn't happened with any other company's blog before. Granted, I don't make a habit of seeking this content out (though I probably should), but that's precisely the point: the fixation was unintentional.

**Here are some of my favorites from the design category:**
- [Viget Designer Thinking Explained](https://www.viget.com/articles/designers-surprising-behavior-explained/)

  I'd like to believe it's not just 'Viget designers' that think this way; to me this process is the hallmark of someone who prioritizes the conceptual, high level / big picture approach to _design_.

  I'll make a comparison _yet again_ to the bike shop world... our <s>perpetual inside joke</s> shop ethos was to always pause, backpedal, and ask **"Wait, what is it that you're trying to do here?"** when a customer or employee was going too far down the rabbit hole and lost sight of their goals.

- [Web Brutalism, Seamfulness, and Notion](https://www.viget.com/articles/web-brutalism-seamfulness-and-notion/)

  I like this one because it feels dense and academic without coming across as inaccessible or too pretentious. Also, it's _full_ of <s>tangential easter eggs</s> links that can jumpstart all sorts of stimulating research/inspiration spikes. Plus, it's hard _not_ to appreciate the imposing and powerful nature of brutalist architecture on some level. Then the author ties that back to... web design and a productivity app?! _Awesome._

- [What UX Designers Can Learn From Ikea](https://www.viget.com/articles/what-ux-designers-can-learn-from-ikea/)

  This article uses an activity/artifact that is likely familiar to a wide audience of non-designers to detail how much thought and intention could and does go into anything meant for humans to use. They say the best design is _invisible_, and the same goes for smooth, functional, and satisfying user experiences.

- [Design Ethics and the Limits of the Ethical Designer](https://www.viget.com/articles/design-ethics-and-the-limits-of-the-ethical-designer/)

  An honest, direct, big-picture guide to thinking about the "ethical design" problem that has been in the forefront of the design community's concerns for the last few years.

  > Part of this higher calling means growing out of an identity based on the reductive philosophy of [“Don’t Make Me Think”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think) to a more nuanced understanding of our responsibilities as behavior designers and psychological manipulators. **Confining ourselves to a lens of mere usability is a cowardly dodge that has allowed us to ignore our responsibility for too long.** We need to make ethics unignorable in the way we teach, talk about, and practice design.

  That paragraph in particular makes me think of this excellent [talk](https://vimeo.com/3693227360) given by [Jenka Gurfinkel](https://www.socialcreature.com/) at the [Midwest UX Conference](https://2019.midwestuxconference.com/) in 2019. The content of that presentation targets a slightly different, but in my opinion parallel, concern than in the quote above.
