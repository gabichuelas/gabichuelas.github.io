I love it when I come across an article that eloquently lays out how I feel about something, or describes it in much better detail than I could â€”_unless of course I was also specifically trying to sit down and also work hard at producing a fantastic article about said topic :)._

I've been spending an inordinate amount of time on the [Viget blog](https://www.viget.com/articles/). Every time I think I'm done, I keep coming back and getting sucked in for hours. This hasn't happened with any other company's blog before. Granted, I don't make a habit of seeking this content out (though I probably should), but that's precisely the point: the fixation was unintentional.

**Here are some of my favorites:**
- [Viget Designer Thinking Explained](https://www.viget.com/articles/designers-surprising-behavior-explained/)

  I'd like to believe it's not just 'Viget designers' that think this way; to me this process is the hallmark of someone who prioritizes the conceptual, high level / big picture approach to _design_.

  I'll make a comparison _yet again_ to the bike shop world... our ~perpetual inside joke~ shop ethos was to always pause, backpedal, and ask **"Wait, what is it that you're trying to do here?"** when a customer or employee was going too far down the rabbit hole and lost sight of their goals.
