This morning my neighbor asked me if I'd heard about the violence going on in Mozambique, and alluded to it being about ethnic group genocide & religious influences. 

The insurgency is being led by islamists, but the conflict appears to be less about religious extremism, and more about a frustrated people continuing to suffer under the corruption and lopsided distribution of wealth that usually follows discoveries of abundant stores of natural resources&#151;in this case, rubies & natural gas.

I was kind of surprised not to find more readily available info on the subject, but here's a decent [article from the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54183948) that provides some historical / regional context.
