Today a coworker told me about [ImportYeti](https://www.importyeti.com/), a tool that [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaveMApplegate) recently created out of pandemic-induced idleness and a desire to build something people would actually use and enjoy.

It was initially interesting because the link shared was one that showed the profile for the company I currently work at (a bicycle parts distributor) which listed the company's international suppliers and corresponding shipment volumes. 

Then that got me thinking about how I recently became aware that there's a global [shipping container shortage](https://www.hillebrand.com/media/publication/where-are-all-the-containers-the-global-shortage-explained) due to a combination of factors brought on by the pandemic including general restrictions, reduced workforce, and increased demand in consumer goods. This in turn resulted in containers sitting around at receiving ports longer than usual, delaying the return of empty containers expected back in Asia.  

The bicycle industry boomed in 2020 once people realized (or remembered) that bicycles are an excellent way to exercise, commute, and possibly even socialize safely during a pandemic*, helping preserve one's mental sanity. 

_* I realize that this is a controversial statement, but I won't be tackling that here._

Consequently, there's a massive shortage of bicycles and repair parts that's been keeping distributors scrambling to keep inventory on the shelves, exacerbated by insufficient production of goods and the aforementioned global container shortage. 

Anyways, not really going anywhere with this that isn't already obvious, but it's got my head swirling with words like 'shipping logistics, emerging markets, niche services, post-pandemic economics, supply chains, transparency, consumer awareness' and more.

Should be interesting to see if/how/when ImportYeti blows up, and what the main user demographic will be.
