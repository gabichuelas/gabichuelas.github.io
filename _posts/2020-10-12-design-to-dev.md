**Why transition from design to development?**

- The feedback cycle in programming is a little more immediate and specific; things either work or they don’t.

- There’s less ambiguity in terms of figuring out what direction to go in...
I work well with constraints, and the constraints in coding are similar to the ones I found in bicycle mechanics concerning functional choices and parts compatibility

- It represents acceptance of my strengths and not thinking I'm flawed for feeling less comfortable with pure visual design, and the ‘blank canvas’ ideation phase

- Programming feels more objective and rational than design, and feeds my brain’s hunger for logical pursuits as well as giving me a specific environment to exercise restrained creativity

- Feels like the equivalent of "working with my hands" but in an abstract, digital sense
