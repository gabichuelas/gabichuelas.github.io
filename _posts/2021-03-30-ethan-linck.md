This morning, in pursuit of some literary fodder to start my day, and it being too early yet to count on the newsletters that have been decorating my email as of the last few months, I visited the Substack homepage to see if I couldn't browse my way into something interesting. 

I clicked on the _science_ tag, and halfway down the list was a page called _Treethinking_. I picked it mostly for the name, and what I found was a colorful and richly written [essay](https://ethanlinck.substack.com/p/parrots-fire-questions) that touched on nostalgia, ecological history, and parrots (!) all at once. I'm feeling a little lazy right now about describing the particular sensations that I felt while chewing on those words, but the point is that I decided to go down that rabbit hole just for a moment.

An "evolutionary biologist and ecologist by training" named [Ethan Linck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-linck-91467885/) was behind that piece, and after some poking around I found that his other work is just as satisfying. For the curious:


[Your Stoke Won't Save Us](https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.8/recreation-your-stoke-wont-save-us/) — _May 2018_
<br>_The idea that outdoor recreation leads to meaningful conservation rests on a big ‘if.’_

[Darwinian Sexual Selection and the Politics of Beauty](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/darwinian-sexual-selection-and-the-politics-of-beauty/#!) — _October 2017_
<br>_I almost included a favorite quote from this last piece, until I realized that it would paint an incomplete picture of why I loved the article itself: the noticeable self-awareness and self-critiquing; two characteristics that my overly analytical brain&#151;with its handicapping-level of indecision, and openness to new and conflicting information&#151;really enjoys._ 

Thanks for the reads, Dr. Linck. Take me on a Santa Fe hike sometime?
