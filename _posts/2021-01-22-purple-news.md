### Warning: politics.

I’m super exhausted with the seemingly mandatory requirement of "you’re either one side or the other" and lack of general tolerance in the mainstream for voices encouraging critical examination of both sides and that want to point out all the gray in between. 

It just rubs me the wrong way on a basic human level, and makes me feel like there is no way forward out of the "culture war" that’s being exploited by people in power everywhere.

I think for this reason I’ve been gravitating towards political journalism and news sources that feel either like they're going out of their way to deliver more balanced content, or take a high-level approach to current events where the focus is less on the individual details and more on the big picture, emphasizing both historical context and long-term consequences. 

I feel like people often forget that _context is everything_... and maybe that's just my flawed opinion. :shrug: [Ortega Y Gasset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset#%22Yo_soy_yo_y_mi_circunstancia%22), anyone?

I also understand there is some valid criticism of this perspective. Something along the lines of "excessive cynicism hampers progress", and wanting to believe there are still people driven by working for a genuine greater good, that we're not just extras in someone else's movie. 

I could try and draw a far-reaching parallel here between the way I feel about this perspective, and say, Absurdism...but I feel like that's an entirely different flavor of conversation. 

### What I've been enjoying lately

I've been reading a bunch of [Matt Taibbi](https://taibbi.substack.com/) and [Glenn Greenwald](https://greenwald.substack.com/), although Greenwald's started to sound a bit like a broken record lately and I’m not enjoying it as much. To me, their writing seems pretty level headed if you don’t succumb to immediate emotional knee-jerk reactions, and deals mostly with the importance of independent journalism, the dangers of censorship (of any kind), and writing pieces that include substantial historical context as a way of setting a stage.

I just finished Taibbi's book, [The Great Derangement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1948003.The_Great_Derangement?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=BJlJaiuoC3&rank=1), which is especially fascinating because it's from 2008 but feels like it could have been written sometime in the last couple of years.

In an attempt to make sure I’m not only consuming news from left-leaning outlets (previously I read mostly The New Yorker, The Times, and the Atlantic), I’ve also been receiving email newsletters from [The Dispatch](https://thedispatch.com/), which calls itself “fact-based reporting and commentary on politics, policy and culture — informed by conservative principles”. Can’t complain about "the other side" without actually getting to know them, and I genuinely feel good when I can find similarities and common ground across the spectrum.

My favorite new find, however, has been the [Tangle](https://tangle.substack.com/) newsletter. Tangle, like the other sources I linked here, is also on Substack, which is apparently the hottest new blogging platform. Backed by Andreessen VC money and successfully luring in a good handful of well-known journalists-going-independent, it keeps showing up all over my immediate information-sphere and random internet wandering.

Tangle's tagline: "an independent, ad-free, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum — then 'my take.'" I especially appreciate how he includes reader feedback in every newsletter, and takes pains to be as transparent and balanced in what he addresses.
