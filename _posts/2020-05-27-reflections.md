**The most important thing I've learned in the past two years** is that maybe the reason I'm not doing the things I berate myself for not doing, is that I don't actually want to do—or be doing—them, but something has made me feel like I'm supposed to.

_Sanity Check:_ Is this radical thought actually just radical to me, and a sizeable portion of the population has always understood it to be true?

Once you stop punishing yourself for all the things that at some point you determined were undesirable, something really wonderful starts to happen: you give yourself room to shift your attention—to the best of your ability while also taking into account personal context—to the things that you don't have to _try so hard_ to pay attention to.

_Is this what people mean when they say 'learn to recognize your strengths?'_

It's tempting to scoff at myself for sounding like a self-help article, but instead I'm just letting myself enjoy the particular kind of bright pleasure that I'm treated to when I'm truly able to **feel** the meaning of whatever piece of wisdom someone has tried to impart in the past.

_Yes, I really like run-on sentences. I blame it on Spanish._

Hearing something 50 times is not in any way a significant substitute for knowing it for yourself.

That one I got from the longest conversation I'd ever had with my eldest half-brother. He sat in the wheelchair a car accident had temporarily confined him to, as we both made honest attempts to catch each other up on the lives we hadn't shared. I tried to talk him into quitting cigarettes, and he told me that you can't make someone quit, they have to want to.

_No, he's not dead._

'Knowing it for yourself' is a way of carrying words away from existing as useless platitudes, and dropping them in the realm of genuine, empathetic self-expression in my brain.

_Thanks, Feels._

_Remember Xanga? Yeah, I didn't either. That was the last time I decided putting thoughts on the internet was a neat idea. Blogging is now hot shit, and we'd all better get on it!_
